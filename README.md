Use ROS to emulate message types for the robot platform



====================
Gatekeeper node - takes in all commands going to the modules, routes to a gate node based on an internal model

Gate node - talks to a physical serial port (Gate1 talks to UART1, etc)


Gatekeeper routes commands whole, Gates translate the command into something the module understands based on the API


Gatekeeper calibrates (ie changing values of inputs before they go to Gates, or outputs before they go back out into the ROS wilds)??
